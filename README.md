This is going to be a hub of tools or maybe a wesbite of tools I plan to create to help me in my journey at Hive Helsinki.

## Blackhole-Calculator
So this is a pretty simple tool all things considered. You give your current level (for example if you are level 4 and 62% of the way to level 5 you mark it down as 4.62) and press enter.
It then prompts you for the amount of XP you would be earning from the project.
It returns back the amount of days you would get from completing that project, the level you would reach from completing said project and prompts you if you want to continue or exit the program.
You do need python to run this script. You run it by using something like python3.
```
> python3 blackhole_days.py
```
